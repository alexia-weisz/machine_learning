Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel, 1959)

**INTRODUCTION**
Grew out of work in AI -- new capabilities for computers

Good for database mining -- industry, medicine, biology, engineering, etc; many examples of where machine learning allows us to take large amounts of data and use it

good for applications that we can't program by hand -- e.g., how do you write a program to make a helicopter fly by itself?

good for self-customizing programs -- amazon, netflix reccomendations

good for understanding how humans learn --  brain, real AI

A computer is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. (Tom Mitchell, 1998)

Supervised learning -- we teach the computer about something
Unsupervised learning -- the computer learns for itself

Supervised learning -- we know the right answer and need to figure out how to teach the computer how to get that answer with the available data.
-- Regression -- continuous output
-- Classificiation -- discrete output
